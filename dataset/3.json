Icarus ' father warns him first of complacency and then of hubris , asking that he fly neither too low nor too high , so the sea 's dampness would not clog his wings or the sun 's heat melt them . Icarus ignored his father 's instructions not to fly too close to the sun ; when the wax in his wings melted he tumbled out of the sky and fell into the sea where he drowned ."

Her mother died when she was five years old . Her catchphrases during the early seasons of the series include `` how rude ! , '' `` well , pin a rose on your nose ! '' and `` hot dog '' . She eventually evolved into something of a tomboy in seasons four and five . Stephanie has a habit of spying on D.J. 's life by reading her diary and eavesdropping on her telephone calls ( having been caught in the act several times ) , and is generally the most athletic and nosiest of the Tanner girls . Her best friends in school are Gia Mahan and Mickey , whom she meets in season seven ( the former is the only one who appears through to season eight ) . Of the three sisters , Stephanie has dealt with the toughest issues , such as peer pressure into smoking ( in season seven 's `` Fast Friends '' ) , `` make - out '' parties ( in season eight 's `` Making Out is Hard to Do '' ) , joyriding ( in season eight 's `` Stephanie 's Wild Ride '' ) , and uncovering a classmate 's child abuse ( in season six 's `` Silence is Not Golden '' ) , as well as the death of her mother when she was only five . In her early years , she is very sentimental about Mr. Bear , a stuffed animal that her mother gave to her after Michelle was born ( this was the focal point of the season two episode `` Goodbye Mr. Bear '' ) . She and Jesse are the most abrasive when it comes to how they feel about Kimmy Gibbler ."

The lyrics are written in the form of a conversation with God, with Chris Martin expressing his frustration and confusion to a higher power.\n\nThe music video for the song features Chris Martin singing the song in reverse. This was done as a visual representation of the theme of the song, which is about trying to fix something that is broken and not being able to fully succeed.\n\nOverall, \"I Will Try to Fix You\" is a powerful and emotional song that explores themes of vulnerability, hope, and the struggle to find fixing in a world that often seems broken.",

      "A new design for ten - shilling notes was introduced in 1961 , with the old notes ceasing to be legal tender in 1962 . These new series C notes were slightly longer and narrower , and were the first ten - shilling notes to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II on the front . The reverse design incorporated the logo of the Bank of England . In the late 1960s it was decided that future banknotes should feature a British historical figure on the reverse . The first such note was the series D \u00a3 20 note , first issued in 1970 , featuring William Shakespeare . A design for a ten - shilling note featuring Walter Raleigh on the reverse was approved in 1964 but was never issued . Instead , in 1969 , as part of the process of decimalisation , a new fifty pence coin was introduced as a replacement for the ten - shilling note . The principal reason for the change was economy : the notes had an average lifetime of about five months whereas coins could last at least fifty years . The series C ten shilling notes ceased to be legal tender on 22 November 1970 ."

It can also be used to acknowledge the impossibility of a situation , in the same way that `` pigs might fly '' is used . An example is if one says : `` I may agree that if two plus two equals five , then I am a monkey 's uncle '' . `` I 'll be a monkey 's uncle '' has been said to date from after 1925 , the date of the widely publicized Scopes Trial in the United States , where the term first appears . The Oxford English Dictionary 's earliest example is the phrase If that 's a joke I 'm a monkey 's uncle , from an Ohio newspaper on 8 February 1925 . It was originally a sarcastic remark made by creationists . The notion `` that ( people ) were descended from apes was considered blasphemous ... by Darwin 's contemporaries '' , and it was for this reason that the sarcastic phrase came into use ."

      "Perry is a surname with several distinct origins . In England deriving from the Old English pyrige ( pear tree ) , referring to one who dwells by a pear tree , while in Wales Perry , along with Parry , arose as patronymics , via a shortening of `` ap Harry '' ( son of Harry ) . There are some variants in the Romance or Romantic languages ( derived from the Latin ) : Pereira , Pereyra , Pereyro , Pereiro , Pereiros Pereire , Perera , Perer , Perero , Pereros ; the Norman French perrieur ( quarry ) , possibly referring to a quarryman . Perry was recorded as a surname from the late 16th century in villages near Colchester , Essex , East England , such as Lexden and Copford . Perry has some resemblance with the Portuguese common surname Pereira , which means pear tree in Portuguese language . Because of that , many Portuguese immigrants to the USA ( especially Massachusetts ) chose to `` Americanize '' their Pereira surname to Perry . The Italian surname , Perri , related to `` Peter '' , is also often Americanized to Perry ."

The Christians had been causing trouble for the Muslims in the early days of Islam, and the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) had decided to take action against them. The Muslim army, which was only around 300 strong, was vastly outnumbered by the Christian army of around 2,000 men.\n\nThe battle was a decisive victory for the Muslims, with many of the Christian leaders killed or captured.

The battle has been passed down in Islamic history as a decisive victory attributable to divine intervention , or by secular sources to the strategic genius of Muhammad . It is one of the few battles specifically mentioned in the Quran . All knowledge of the battle at Badr comes from traditional Islamic accounts , both hadiths and biographies of Muhammad , recorded in written form some time after the battle . There is little evidence outside of these of the battle . There are no descriptions of the battle prior to the 9th Century ."

      "The Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis was a successful effort by the then - owner of the Baltimore Colts ( Robert Irsay ) to move the American football team from Baltimore , Maryland to Indianapolis , Indiana . The team began play as the Indianapolis Colts for the 1984 National Football League ( NFL ) season . The Colts ' move was completely unannounced and occurred in the early hours of March 29 , 1984 , after years of lobbying for a new stadium to replace the inadequate Memorial Stadium . The franchise 's move continues to embitter many Baltimore natives decades afterward , and would have a lasting impact on the NFL , including another controversial relocation twelve years later that resulted in Baltimore receiving its current NFL team , the Ravens ."
