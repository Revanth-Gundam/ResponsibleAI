Brown 's party of 22 was defeated by a company of U.S. Marines , led by First Lieutenant Israel Greene . Colonel Robert E. Lee was in overall command of the operation to retake the arsenal . John Brown had originally asked Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass , both of whom he had met in his transformative years as an abolitionist in Springfield , Massachusetts , to join him in his raid , but Tubman was prevented by illness and Douglass declined , as he believed Brown 's plan would fail ."

She eventually evolved into something of a tomboy in seasons four and five . Stephanie has a habit of spying on D.J.

Her best friends in school are Gia Mahan and Mickey , whom she meets in season seven ( the former is the only one who appears through to season eight ) . Of the three sisters , Stephanie has dealt with the toughest issues , such as peer pressure into smoking ( in season seven 's `` Fast Friends '' ) , `` make - out '' parties ( in season eight 's `` Making Out is Hard to Do '' ) , joyriding ( in season eight 's `` Stephanie 's Wild Ride '' ) , and uncovering a classmate 's child abuse ( in season six 's `` Silence is Not Golden '' ) , as well as the death of her mother when she was only five . In her early years , she is very sentimental about Mr. Bear , a stuffed animal that her mother gave to her after Michelle was born ( this was the focal point of the season two episode `` Goodbye Mr. Bear '' ) .

These new series C notes were slightly longer and narrower , and were the first ten - shilling notes to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II on the front . The reverse design incorporated the logo of the Bank of England . In the late 1960s it was decided that future banknotes should feature a British historical figure on the reverse . The first such note was the series D \u00a3 20 note , first issued in 1970 , featuring William Shakespeare . A design for a ten - shilling note featuring Walter Raleigh on the reverse was approved in 1964 but was never issued . Instead , in 1969 , as part of the process of decimalisation , a new fifty pence coin was introduced as a replacement for the ten - shilling note . The principal reason for the change was economy : the notes had an average lifetime of about five months whereas coins could last at least fifty years . The series C ten shilling notes ceased to be legal tender on 22 November 1970 ."

In England deriving from the Old English pyrige ( pear tree ) , referring to one who dwells by a pear tree , while in Wales Perry , along with Parry , arose as patronymics , via a shortening of `` ap Harry '' ( son of Harry ) . There are some variants in the Romance or Romantic languages ( derived from the Latin ) : Pereira , Pereyra , Pereyro , Pereiro , Pereiros Pereire , Perera , Perer , Perero , Pereros ; the Norman French perrieur ( quarry ) , possibly referring to a quarryman . Perry was recorded as a surname from the late 16th century in villages near Colchester , Essex , East England , such as Lexden and Copford . Perry has some resemblance with the Portuguese common surname Pereira , which means pear tree in Portuguese language . Because of that , many Portuguese immigrants to the USA ( especially Massachusetts ) chose to `` Americanize '' their Pereira surname to Perry . The Italian surname , Perri , related to `` Peter '' , is also often Americanized to Perry ."

The battle has been passed down in Islamic history as a decisive victory attributable to divine intervention , or by secular sources to the strategic genius of Muhammad . It is one of the few battles specifically mentioned in the Quran .

Most of the brain 's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge ( membrane potential ) of neurons . Most vertebrate species devote between 2 % and 8 % of basal metabolism to the brain . In primates , however , the percentage is much higher -- in humans it rises to 20 -- 25 % . The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time , but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions ; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET , fMRI , and NIRS . The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen - dependent metabolism of glucose ( i.e. , blood sugar ) , but ketones provide a major alternative source , together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids ( caprylic and heptanoic acids ) , lactate , acetate , and possibly amino acids ."

These electors then in turn cast direct votes , known as electoral votes , for President , and for Vice President . The candidate who receives an absolute majority of electoral votes ( at least 270 out of a total of 538 , since the Twenty - Third Amendment granting voting rights to citizens of Washington , D.C. ) is then elected to that office .
