    "response": "The term \"Parsons nose\" is a colloquialism used in the United Kingdom and Ireland to refer to the upturned nose of a bird, particularly a bird of prey. The term is derived from the name of a famous English ornithologist, Frank Parsons, who was known for his distinctive upturned nose.\n\nParsons was a well-known birdwatcher and naturalist who lived in the early 20th century. He was particularly interested in birds of prey, and his passion for these birds led him to become a prominent figure in the field of ornithology.\n\nOver time, Parsons' distinctive nose became a recognizable feature among birdwatchers and naturalists, and it became a sort of inside joke among them to refer to the upturned nose of a bird as a \"Parsons nose.\" The term has since become widely used in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and is often used in birdwatching circles to describe the distinctive nose of a bird of prey.\n\nIt's worth noting that the term \"Parsons nose\" is not a formal scientific term, but rather a colloquialism that has been adopted by birdwatchers and naturalists as a way of describing a distinctive feature of certain birds.",

      "The phrase `` parson 's nose '' comes from the notion that an English parson may ' have his nose up in the air ' , upturned like the chicken 's rear end . The term must have been known as early as around 1400 AD , when a carpenter had been contracted to provide new choir stalls for St Mary 's Church , Nantwich . The vicar was either slow to pay the artisan , or did not pay at all . In retaliation , on the last misericord in the stalls , the carpenter carved a bird with an image of that Vicar 's face with protuberant nose as rump . The carving is still visible today ."

Christian was a member of the band and played a Gibson ES-150, which was one of the first commercially produced electric guitars.\n\nThe recording, which took place on August 1, 1939, was of a song called \"Flying Home,\" and it featured Christian's electric guitar playing a solo and providing rhythm accompaniment. The recording was released as a 78 rpm record and became a hit, helping to popularize the electric guitar as a jazz instrument.\n\nIt's worth noting that there were other musicians who experimented with electric guitars before Christian, but his recording with the Benny Goodman Sextet is generally considered to be the first commercial recording featuring an electric guitar.",

However, some notable milestones and pioneers in the field include:\n\n1. CCTV (Closed-Circuit Television): CCTV was invented in the 1940s by a team of engineers at the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation). They developed a system that could transmit live images from a camera to a monitor, which was initially used for internal communication and monitoring purposes within the BBC. This technology laid the foundation for modern CCTV systems used in home security.\n2. Video Door Phones: The first video door phone was invented in the 1960s by a Japanese company, Panasonic (then known as Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.). This system allowed homeowners to see and communicate with visitors at their door via a camera and intercom.\n3. Home Security Systems: In the 1970s and 1980s, home security systems started to become more sophisticated, incorporating features like motion detectors, door and window sensors, and alarm systems. Companies like ADT (American District Telegraph) and Brinks Home Security were among the early providers of these systems.\n4. Digital Video",

      "In Greek mythology , Icarus ( the Latin spelling , conventionally adopted in English ; Ancient Greek : \u1f3c\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 , \u00cdkaros , Etruscan : Vikare ) is the son of the master craftsman Daedalus , the creator of the Labyrinth . Often depicted in art , Icarus and his father attempt to escape from Crete by means of wings that his father constructed from feathers and wax . Icarus ' father warns him first of complacency and then of hubris , asking that he fly neither too low nor too high , so the sea 's dampness would not clog his wings or the sun 's heat melt them . Icarus ignored his father 's instructions not to fly too close to the sun ; when the wax in his wings melted he tumbled out of the sky and fell into the sea where he drowned ."

Her mother died when she was five years old . Her catchphrases during the early seasons of the series include `` how rude ! , '' `` well , pin a rose on your nose ! '' and `` hot dog '' . She eventually evolved into something of a tomboy in seasons four and five . Stephanie has a habit of spying on D.J. 's life by reading her diary and eavesdropping on her telephone calls ( having been caught in the act several times ) , and is generally the most athletic and nosiest of the Tanner girls . Her best friends in school are Gia Mahan and Mickey , whom she meets in season seven ( the former is the only one who appears through to season eight ) . Of the three sisters , Stephanie has dealt with the toughest issues , such as peer pressure into smoking ( in season seven 's `` Fast Friends '' ) , `` make - out '' parties ( in season eight 's `` Making Out is Hard to Do '' ) , joyriding ( in season eight 's `` Stephanie 's Wild Ride '' ) , and uncovering a classmate 's child abuse ( in season six 's `` Silence is Not Golden '' ) , as well as the death of her mother when she was only five . In her early years , she is very sentimental about Mr. Bear , a stuffed animal that her mother gave to her after Michelle was born ( this was the focal point of the season two episode `` Goodbye Mr. Bear '' ) . She and Jesse are the most abrasive when it comes to how they feel about Kimmy Gibbler ."
