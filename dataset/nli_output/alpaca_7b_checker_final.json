James ' first All - Star MVP in 2006 made him the youngest to have ever won the award at the age of 21 years , 1 month . Kyrie Irving , winner of the 2014 All - Star Game MVP , is the second - youngest at 21 years , 10 months . They are notable as being the two youngest to win the award , both as Cleveland Cavaliers . Four of the games had joint winners -- Elgin Baylor and Pettit in 1959 , John Stockton and Malone in 1993 , O'Neal and Tim Duncan in 2000 , and O'Neal and Bryant in 2009 . O'Neal became the first player in All - Star history to share two MVP awards as well as the first player to win the award with multiple teams . The Los Angeles Lakers have had eleven winners while the Boston Celtics have had eight . Duncan of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Irving of Australia are the only winners not born in the United States . Both Duncan and Irving are American citizens , but are considered `` international '' players by the NBA because they were not born in one of the fifty states or Washington , D.C. No player trained entirely outside the U.S. has won the award ; Irving lived in the U.S. since age two , and Duncan played U.S. college basketball at Wake Forest ."

Hunley demonstrated the advantages and the dangers of undersea warfare . She was the first combat submarine to sink a warship ( USS Housatonic ) , although Hunley was not completely submerged and , following her successful attack , was lost along with her crew before she could return to base . The Confederacy lost 21 crewmen in three sinkings of Hunley during her short career . She was named for her inventor , Horace Lawson Hunley , shortly after she was taken into government service under the control of the Confederate States Army at Charleston , South Carolina ."

      "A new design for ten - shilling notes was introduced in 1961 , with the old notes ceasing to be legal tender in 1962 . These new series C notes were slightly longer and narrower , and were the first ten - shilling notes to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II on the front . The reverse design incorporated the logo of the Bank of England . In the late 1960s it was decided that future banknotes should feature a British historical figure on the reverse . The first such note was the series D \u00a3 20 note , first issued in 1970 , featuring William Shakespeare . A design for a ten - shilling note featuring Walter Raleigh on the reverse was approved in 1964 but was never issued . Instead , in 1969 , as part of the process of decimalisation , a new fifty pence coin was introduced as a replacement for the ten - shilling note . The principal reason for the change was economy : the notes had an average lifetime of about five months whereas coins could last at least fifty years . The series C ten shilling notes ceased to be legal tender on 22 November 1970 ."

An example is if one says : `` I may agree that if two plus two equals five , then I am a monkey 's uncle '' . `` I 'll be a monkey 's uncle '' has been said to date from after 1925 , the date of the widely publicized Scopes Trial in the United States , where the term first appears . The Oxford English Dictionary 's earliest example is the phrase If that 's a joke I 'm a monkey 's uncle , from an Ohio newspaper on 8 February 1925 . It was originally a sarcastic remark made by creationists . The notion `` that ( people ) were descended from apes was considered blasphemous ... by Darwin 's contemporaries '' , and it was for this reason that the sarcastic phrase came into use ."

      "Perry is a surname with several distinct origins . In England deriving from the Old English pyrige ( pear tree ) , referring to one who dwells by a pear tree , while in Wales Perry , along with Parry , arose as patronymics , via a shortening of `` ap Harry '' ( son of Harry ) . There are some variants in the Romance or Romantic languages ( derived from the Latin ) : Pereira , Pereyra , Pereyro , Pereiro , Pereiros Pereire , Perera , Perer , Perero , Pereros ; the Norman French perrieur ( quarry ) , possibly referring to a quarryman . Perry was recorded as a surname from the late 16th century in villages near Colchester , Essex , East England , such as Lexden and Copford . Perry has some resemblance with the Portuguese common surname Pereira , which means pear tree in Portuguese language . Because of that , many Portuguese immigrants to the USA ( especially Massachusetts ) chose to `` Americanize '' their Pereira surname to Perry . The Italian surname , Perri , related to `` Peter '' , is also often Americanized to Perry ."

The award announcement acknowledged the fact that `` the world 's nine nuclear - armed powers and their allies '' neither signed nor supported the treaty - based prohibition known as the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons or nuclear ban treaty , yet in an interview Committee Chair Berit Reiss - Andersen told reporters that the award was intended to give `` encouragement to all players in the field '' to disarm . The award was hailed by civil society as well as governmental and intergovernmental representatives who support the nuclear ban treaty , but drew criticism from those opposed . At the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony held in Oslo City Hall on December 10 , 2017 , Setsuko Thurlow , an 85 - year - old survivor of the 1945 atomic bombing of Hiroshima , and ICAN Executive Director Beatrice Fihn jointly received a medal and diploma of the award on behalf of ICAN and delivered the Nobel lecture ."

It is one of the few battles specifically mentioned in the Quran .

Accordingly , large quantities of antivenom may be needed to reverse the progression of symptoms developed if bitten by a king cobra . The toxins affect the victim 's central nervous system , resulting in severe pain , blurred vision , vertigo , drowsiness , and eventually paralysis . If the envenomation is serious , it progresses to cardiovascular collapse , and the victim falls into a coma . Death soon follows due to respiratory failure . Bites from a king cobra may result in a rapid fatality which can be as early as 30 minutes after the envenomation . The king cobra 's envenomation was even recorded to be capable of killing elephants within hours ."

      "Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume , so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals . The need to limit body weight in order , for example , to fly , has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species , such as bats . Most of the brain 's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge ( membrane potential ) of neurons . Most vertebrate species devote between 2 % and 8 % of basal metabolism to the brain . In primates , however , the percentage is much higher -- in humans it rises to 20 -- 25 % . The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time , but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions ; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET , fMRI , and NIRS . The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen - dependent metabolism of glucose ( i.e. , blood sugar ) , but ketones provide a major alternative source , together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids ( caprylic and heptanoic acids ) , lactate , acetate , and possibly amino acids ."
