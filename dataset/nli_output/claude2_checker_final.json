The stereotype was that parsons were overweight or fond of food and drink.\n\n- It was considered the best and fattiest part of a chicken, which may be why it got compared to what a parson or priest may especially enjoy eating.\n\n- The term remained common in the UK into the 20th century but is less well known in the US today.

However, here are a few potential possibilities:\n\n- In some Curious George books and TV episodes, there is a dog named Charkie that belongs to the man with the yellow hat. Charkie is usually depicted as a medium-sized mutt or mixed breed dog. His fur is brown, black, and white.\n\n- There is also a Great Dane character named Charkie that appears in some Curious George media. This Charkie is owned by Chef Pisghetti. \n\n- In the 2006 Curious George movie, there is a female bulldog that is sometimes referred to as Charkie. She belongs to the Bloomsberry family.\n\n- In some Curious George coloring books and kids books, a generic dog character is named Charkie. The breed is not specified.\n\nSo in summary, there is not one consistent dog breed for the character Charkie across all Curious George series and adaptations. But most often Charkie is depicted as either a mutt or a Great Dane. Let me know if you need any clarification on which specific version of Charkie you are asking about!",

It's likely he has a home in Annapolis.\n\n- Baltimore, Maryland - In the Patriot Games film adaptation, Ryan and his family are shown living in a townhouse in Baltimore at the start of the movie. \n\n- London, England - In both the novel and film, Ryan and his family are attacked while vacationing in London. It's unclear if they live in London or are just visiting.\n\n- Washington D.C. - As a CIA analyst, it is possible Ryan owns or rents a residence in the Washington D.C. area in addition to any other homes.\n\nWithout more specific details from the sources, I can't pinpoint his exact home location(s).

      "response": " In the original Terminator film from 1984, the role of John Connor was played by actor Michael Edwards. Some key facts:\n\n- The Terminator was released in 1984 and was directed by James Cameron. It starred Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator.\n\n- Michael Edwards was cast as John Connor, the future leader of the human resistance against machines in the post-apocalyptic future. \n\n- Since John Connor is just a child in the first Terminator film, Edwards was only 13 years old when he took on the role.\n\n- While Edwards was the actor who physically portrayed John Connor on screen, the voice of John heard over the radio in a few scenes was provided by Michael Biehn. Biehn went on to portray Kyle Reese in the first film.\n\n- In subsequent Terminator sequels, the adult John Connor has been played by other actors like Edward Furlong, Nick Stahl, Christian Bale, and Jason Clarke. But in the original, Michael Edwards was the first to bring the pivotal character to life.\n\nSo in summary, Michael Edwards was the actor who played the young John Connor in the 1984 sci-fi classic The Terminator, establishing the character that would be central to the franchise.",

The results show where the couples in the bottom two dance off and one is eliminated is typically recorded on the Saturday night, shortly after the main live show airs. Here are some key details about the Strictly results show recording:\n\n- The main live show airs on Saturday evenings on BBC One, usually around 7-8pm UK time.\n\n- Once the phone lines close after the main show, the studio audience stays in place and the results show is recorded straight away. This usually starts around 9:30-10pm.\n\n- The results show is pre-recorded so that no information leaks out before it airs on TV. \n\n- The Sunday results show then airs around 7:30pm UK time, about 24 hours after it was recorded on the Saturday night.\n\n- The couples in the dance off perform their routines again and the judges vote on who to save right after the main show, but this is edited down for the Sunday broadcast.\n\nSo in summary, the Strictly Come Dancing results show is recorded late on Saturday night, shortly after the live main show, and then aired the following evening on Sunday. This allows the results to remain secret until the broadcast.",

However, here are some details about the show that may provide clues:\n\n- The Crossing was a science fiction drama that aired for one season on ABC in 2018. \n\n- It was about refugees from a war-torn country in the future who travel back in time to seek asylum in the present-day United States.\n\n- The show filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, which is a common location for filming TV shows and movies due to tax incentives and diverse landscapes that can stand in for many locations.\n\n- Other filming locations may have included areas around Vancouver used to represent the fictional town of Port Canaan, Oregon where the show was set. \n\nSo while Vancouver seems to have been a primary filming site, the exact shooting locations for The Crossing are not definitively known publicly.

      "response": " There is some debate around exactly who invented the first home video security system, but here are some key developments:\n\n- In 1949, German inventor Walter Bruch helped develop the technology for closed circuit television (CCTV), which allowed for video monitoring of private spaces. This laid the groundwork for modern video surveillance systems.\n\n- In 1969, CCTV systems were installed in some public spaces like banks and convenience stores for security monitoring. \n\n- In the 1970s, home CCTV systems first became commercially available, though they were expensive and not widely adopted at first. A company called VideoScan is sometimes credited with releasing the first home CCTV system in the 1970s.\n\n- In the 1980s, more affordable home security cameras and recording systems started hitting the consumer market. Companies like Radio Shack, ADT, and Brinks offered early home security systems. \n\n- In the 1990s, home security cameras became more widespread as technology improved and prices dropped. The X10 company offered some of the first wire-free security cameras for the home during this time.\n\nSo in summary, while CCTV and closed-circuit monitoring originated in the 1940s and 1950s, home video security systems emerged for consumers in the 1970s and became more popular and affordable throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The technology built on decades of CCTV development.",

        "Stephanie Judith Tanner ( portrayed by Jodie Sweetin ) is the witty , sarcastic middle child of Danny and Pam , the younger sister of D.J. , and the older sister of Michelle . Her mother died when she was five years old . Her catchphrases during the early seasons of the series include `` how rude ! , '' `` well , pin a rose on your nose ! '' and `` hot dog '' . She eventually evolved into something of a tomboy in seasons four and five . Stephanie has a habit of spying on D.J. 's life by reading her diary and eavesdropping on her telephone calls ( having been caught in the act several times ) , and is generally the most athletic and nosiest of the Tanner girls . Her best friends in school are Gia Mahan and Mickey , whom she meets in season seven ( the former is the only one who appears through to season eight ) . Of the three sisters , Stephanie has dealt with the toughest issues , such as peer pressure into smoking ( in season seven 's `` Fast Friends '' ) , `` make - out '' parties ( in season eight 's `` Making Out is Hard to Do '' ) , joyriding ( in season eight 's `` Stephanie 's Wild Ride '' ) , and uncovering a classmate 's child abuse ( in season six 's `` Silence is Not Golden '' ) , as well as the death of her mother when she was only five . In her early years , she is very sentimental about Mr. Bear , a stuffed animal that her mother gave to her after Michelle was born ( this was the focal point of the season two episode `` Goodbye Mr. Bear '' ) . She and Jesse are the most abrasive when it comes to how they feel about Kimmy Gibbler ."

Here are some key points about where Bacteroides are typically found:\n\n- The human gut microbiome - Bacteroides are one of the most abundant types of bacteria found in the human intestinal microbiota. They make up around 30% of all bacteria in a healthy human gut.\n\n- Lower intestines/colon - Bacteroides are anaerobic bacteria, meaning they thrive in environments with low or no oxygen. They are most abundant in the lower parts of the intestines, especially the colon. \n\n- Mouth - Some species of Bacteroides can also be found in the oral microbiome, though in smaller numbers than in the gut.\n\n- Women's reproductive tract - Bacteroides are commonly found in the vaginal microbiota and can protect against growth of pathogenic bacteria.\n\n- Infant gut - Babies are first colonized with Bacteroides and other bacteria during birth and breastfeeding. Bacteroides make up a major component of a healthy infant gut microbiome.\n\n- Animal guts - Bacteroides are not exclusive to humans - they are also normal residents of the intestinal tracts of many warm-blooded animals.\n\nSo in summary, the main habitat of Bacteroides bacteria is the lower intestinal tract and colon of humans and other animals, where they play important roles in",

So all major British cities are relatively close to the coast. \n\nHowever, some cities are farther inland than others. The largest and most populous cities in the UK tend to be closer to the coast due to historical access to trade and transport by sea.\n\nThe major cities that are farthest from the sea are those that are more centrally located in England or Wales, away from the coasts. \n\nAfter some analysis, the major city that appears to be farthest from the sea in the UK is Birmingham. \n\nBirmingham is located in the West Midlands region of central England. It is about 110 miles (177 km) from the closest sea - the Bristol Channel, part of the Atlantic Ocean. \n\nOther candidates for farthest city from the sea include Manchester and Leeds, but Birmingham just edges them out by a few miles.\n\nSo in summary, Birmingham is likely the major city in the United Kingdom that is farthest from the sea.

He developed the germ theory of disease and the process of pasteurization to kill microbes.\n\n- Robert Koch (1843-1910) - A German physician who identified the bacteria that cause anthrax, tuberculosis, and cholera. He established Koch's postulates to demonstrate that a specific microbe causes a specific disease. \n\n- Joseph Lister (1827-1912) - A British surgeon who pioneered antiseptic surgery by using carbolic acid to kill microbes during surgery. This greatly reduced post-operative infections.\n\n- John Snow (1813-1858) - An English physician who in 1854 traced a cholera outbreak in London to a contaminated public water pump, establishing that cholera was spread by microbes in contaminated water.\n\nSo in summary, the germ theory of disease stating that microorganisms are the cause of many diseases was established in the late 19th century thanks to the pioneering work of scientists like Pasteur, Koch, Lister and Snow through experiments, observations and epidemiological studies. Their work was pivotal in revolutionizing medicine.",

Still, the dwarves are frightened when the bear appears. \n\n- The next morning when the group meets Beorn in his human form, Gandalf informs them that Beorn is a skin-changer who becomes a bear by night.\n\n- Beorn's bear form is powerful and used to patrol the area around his home. He is able to kill intruding orcs and wargs that come near.\n\n- His ability to become a bear is important to the story, as he helps the group escape goblins and wargs by carrying them on his back and tearing through their enemies in bear form.\n\nSo in summary, Beorn is the character who shapeshifts into a large, fierce black bear in The Hobbit.

It involved Aboriginal stockmen and their families walking off Wave Hill Station in the Northern Territory to protest poor pay and working conditions.\n\nSome key facts about the Wave Hill walk-off:\n\n- It began on August 23, 1966 when around 200 Aboriginal stockmen and their families left Wave Hill Station to camp at Wattie Creek. This was led by Vincent Lingiari.\n\n- The protest was against the poor pay and conditions for Aboriginal workers on the British-owned cattle station, as well as the lack of recognition of Aboriginal land rights. \n\n- It continued for over 8 years, making it one of the longest strikes in Australian history. \n\n- In 1975, the Australian government granted the Gurindji people title to part of their traditional lands, marking a major win for Indigenous land rights. \n\n- On August 16, 1975, Prime Minister Gough Whitlam symbolically poured sand into Vincent Lingiari's hand to recognize the Gurindji land rights, in a ceremony at Wave Hill.\n\n- In 1985, the Gurindji were granted additional land rights to more of their traditional lands with the passing of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act.\n\nSo in summary, the Wave Hill walk-off began in August 1966 and the main protest essentially ended in 1975 with the landmark Indigenous land rights victory, after almost 9 years.

Hunley.\n\nIn 1863, Hunley built a small hand-powered submarine called the H. L. Hunley for the Confederate States of America. The Hunley was designed to attack and sink Union ships by stealth, ramming the enemy vessel with a spar torpedo. \n\nOn February 17, 1864, the H. L. Hunley became the first submarine to successfully sink an enemy ship in combat when it attacked the Union sloop USS Housatonic. However, the Hunley also sank shortly after its attack and all eight crew members died. This made the mission the first successful submarine attack in history, but also one of the first submarine disasters.\n\nThough primitive by modern standards, the H.L. Hunley demonstrated the potential of submarine warfare and paved the way for further development of submarine technology. Hunley is considered the pioneer of submarine warfare and his invention was an important milestone in naval history.",

Some key details about the 10 shilling note:\n\n- It was first issued in 1928, replacing the previous 10 shilling Treasury note. The original 1928 design featured a portrait of Britannia on the front.\n\n- The note was changed in the early 1960s to feature a portrait of Florence Nightingale on the front. This updated \"Series C\" 10 shilling note began circulation in 1961.\n\n- With the decimalization of British currency in 1971, the 10 shilling note was withdrawn from circulation. Decimal 10 pence coins replaced the 10 shilling note beginning in 1968 in the run up to full decimalization. \n\n- The last 10 shilling notes were removed from circulation by the early 1970s. Banks were instructed to withdraw any remaining notes by the end of 1970.\n\nSo in summary, the 10 shilling banknote enjoyed over 40 years in circulation from 1928 to the early 1970s, when it was demonetized and pulled from circulation due to the UK's transition to a full decimal currency system. The last notes were withdrawn by banks at the end of 1970.",

These new series C notes were slightly longer and narrower , and were the first ten - shilling notes to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II on the front . The reverse design incorporated the logo of the Bank of England . In the late 1960s it was decided that future banknotes should feature a British historical figure on the reverse . The first such note was the series D \u00a3 20 note , first issued in 1970 , featuring William Shakespeare . A design for a ten - shilling note featuring Walter Raleigh on the reverse was approved in 1964 but was never issued . Instead , in 1969 , as part of the process of decimalisation , a new fifty pence coin was introduced as a replacement for the ten - shilling note . The principal reason for the change was economy : the notes had an average lifetime of about five months whereas coins could last at least fifty years . The series C ten shilling notes ceased to be legal tender on 22 November 1970 ."

This suggests a developing country with economic inequality.\n\n- The kidnappers are rebels/guerrillas who are fighting against the government and targeting foreign oil companies. This implies some degree of civil conflict and unrest.\n\n- Some scenes were filmed on location in Ecuador, so it seems to be loosely inspired by or modeled after certain South American countries like Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela etc. that have faced political turmoil, rebel forces, and kidnappings of foreign oil workers.\n\nSo while not named explicitly, the setting is intended to depict a fictional South American country dealing with economic and political upheaval.

This is the most common way ties are broken.\n\n- Senators can agree to table or postpone the issue that resulted in a tie. This allows them more time to negotiate or bring in absent Senators to vote. \n\n- The Senate Majority Leader can make a motion to reconsider the vote at a later time when more Senators are present.\n\n- For votes on procedural matters, the tie vote means the motion fails. The status quo is preserved. \n\n- On votes to confirm presidential nominations, a tie vote means the nomination fails. \n\nSo in summary, the Vice President can break tie votes with their vote, but Senators have some procedural options as well if they want to revisit a tied vote later. The Vice President has cast over 250 tie-breaking votes since 1789, so it's a very common occurrence.",

There are some variants in the Romance or Romantic languages ( derived from the Latin ) : Pereira , Pereyra , Pereyro , Pereiro , Pereiros Pereire , Perera , Perer , Perero , Pereros ; the Norman French perrieur ( quarry ) , possibly referring to a quarryman . Perry was recorded as a surname from the late 16th century in villages near Colchester , Essex , East England , such as Lexden and Copford . Perry has some resemblance with the Portuguese common surname Pereira , which means pear tree in Portuguese language . Because of that , many Portuguese immigrants to the USA ( especially Massachusetts ) chose to `` Americanize '' their Pereira surname to Perry . The Italian surname , Perri , related to `` Peter '' , is also often Americanized to Perry ."

Ambulatory patients are the opposite of non-ambulatory or bedridden patients.\n\n- Ambulatory care refers to medical services provided on an outpatient basis, without admission to a hospital. This includes visits to a doctor's office, clinic, urgent care center, etc. Ambulatory care is less intensive than inpatient hospital care.\n\n- An ambulatory surgery center is a healthcare facility that specializes in providing same-day surgical care, allowing patients to walk in and out without an overnight stay. Common procedures done at these centers include endoscopies, colonoscopies, cataract surgeries.\n\n- Ambulatory devices are tools designed to assist patients with walking, such as canes, walkers, crutches, etc. These allow patients with injuries, disabilities or mobility issues to move around on their own without major assistance.\n\n- Ambulatory monitoring refers to portable or wearable technology used to track a patient's vital signs or health data while they go about their daily activities. This may include ECG monitors, EEGs, glucose monitors, etc.\n\nIn summary, \"ambulatory\" implies that the patient can walk and move about to some degree, in contrast to bedbound patients who cannot independently move or walk.

But the entire hitting surface cannot exceed 4.25 inches.\n\n- The edges of the bat should also not exceed 1.56 inches in thickness. \n\n- Bat widths have become more standardized in recent decades. In the past, bats with widths up to 4.75 inches were sometimes used.\n\n- Wider bats provide a larger hitting surface but may be less maneuverable. Narrower bats allow for more control and strokeplay.\n\n- Bat width is one factor players consider when selecting a bat for their size, technique and playing style. Other factors include bat length, weight, balance and materials.\n\nSo in summary, 4.25 inches is the maximum legal width for a cricket bat under the sport's rules. Most bats today adhere very closely to this standard width.",

They were owned by Carroll Rosenbloom.\n\n- In 1972, Rosenbloom swapped ownership of the Colts with Robert Irsay, who owned the Los Angeles Rams at the time. This gave Irsay ownership of the Colts.\n\n- Under Irsay's ownership, the Colts struggled both on the field and with attendance in the late 1970s. Irsay began making demands for a new stadium to replace Memorial Stadium in Baltimore. \n\n- When no agreement could be reached on a new stadium, Irsay began discussions with other cities about relocating the team. In the early morning hours of March 29, 1984, Irsay moved the Colts out of Baltimore to Indianapolis. \n\n- So in summary, Robert Irsay was the owner of the Colts when the team controversially left Baltimore for Indianapolis in 1984 after failing to reach a deal for a new stadium.

This is over 20 times more venom than most rattlesnake species.\n\n- An adult king cobra can produce up to 500 mg of venom at a time. This is enough to kill 20 people or even an elephant.\n\n- King cobras can produce new venom as quickly as every 6-7 days. So even after emptying all their stored venom in a bite, they can replenish it fairly quickly.\n\n- The venom glands of a king cobra can hold up to 1-1.5 grams of venom at maximum capacity. However, they don't always store this much.\n\n- Venom production depends on the snake's age, health, season, and frequency of use. Older, healthier snakes tend to produce more venom than younger ones.\n\n- When threatened, king cobras can repeatedly strike and inject venom. The maximum number of bites in a short time period can be over 10-12 for an adult.\n\nSo in summary, an adult king cobra has the potential to inject over 10 ml of venom overall in multiple bites in self-defense. But the average amount of venom used per bite is much lower, around 2-7 ml. Their massive venom capacity makes them one of the most dangerous snakes in the world.",

Engelmann and Obst ( 1981 ) list the average venom yield at 420 mg ( dry weight ) . Accordingly , large quantities of antivenom may be needed to reverse the progression of symptoms developed if bitten by a king cobra . The toxins affect the victim 's central nervous system , resulting in severe pain , blurred vision , vertigo , drowsiness , and eventually paralysis . If the envenomation is serious , it progresses to cardiovascular collapse , and the victim falls into a coma . Death soon follows due to respiratory failure . Bites from a king cobra may result in a rapid fatality which can be as early as 30 minutes after the envenomation .

      "response": " The brain gets most of its energy from glucose. Here are a few key points about how the brain gets energy:\n\n- Glucose is the preferred fuel source for the brain. It gets glucose from the bloodstream.\n\n- The brain cannot store glucose, so it requires a continuous supply from the blood to function properly. \n\n- The brain accounts for about 20% of the body's total energy needs, even though it only makes up about 2% of the body's weight.\n\n- When blood glucose levels drop too low (hypoglycemia), brain function is impaired. That's why having regular food intake is important to maintain normal blood sugar levels.\n\n- Besides glucose, the brain can also use ketone bodies for energy in certain situations like fasting or very low-carbohydrate diets. \n\n- Ketone bodies are derived from fat and can cross the blood-brain barrier to provide the brain with energy.\n\n- The brain also requires oxygen to extract energy from glucose and ketone bodies through cellular respiration. So constant oxygen supply via breathing is essential for brain energy metabolism.\n\nIn summary, the predominant fuel source powering the high energy demands of the brain is glucose transported from the bloodstream. Ketone bodies can provide alternative energy in certain conditions.",

        "Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume , so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals . The need to limit body weight in order , for example , to fly , has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species , such as bats . Most of the brain 's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge ( membrane potential ) of neurons . Most vertebrate species devote between 2 % and 8 % of basal metabolism to the brain . In primates , however , the percentage is much higher -- in humans it rises to 20 -- 25 % . The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time , but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions ; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET , fMRI , and NIRS . The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen - dependent metabolism of glucose ( i.e. , blood sugar ) , but ketones provide a major alternative source , together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids ( caprylic and heptanoic acids ) , lactate , acetate , and possibly amino acids ."

The show has had several moderators since it first aired in 1947, with tenures ranging from a few years to multiple decades. Some of the notable Meet the Press moderators and their approximate tenures include:\n\n- Martha Rountree (1947\u20131953) - 6 years\n- Ned Brooks (1953\u20131965) - 12 years \n- Lawrence E. Spivak (1966\u20131975) - 10 years\n- Bill Monroe (1975\u20131984) - 9 years\n- Marvin Kalb (1984\u20131987) - 3 years\n- Chris Wallace (1987\u20131988) - 2 years\n- Garrick Utley (1989\u20131991) - 3 years\n- Tim Russert (1991\u20132008) - 17 years\n- Tom Brokaw (2008) - Interim moderator for a few months after Russert's death\n- David Gregory (2008\u20132014) - 6 years\n- Chuck Todd (2014\u2013present) - 8 years and counting as of 2022\n\nSo based on the publicly available information, it appears Tim Russert likely had the longest uninterrupted tenure as a full-time Meet the Press moderator at 17 years from 1991 to 2008.

It is a strong synovial joint that allows some movement between the sacrum and hip bones, providing shock absorption in the pelvis.",

In humans , the sacrum supports the spine and is supported in turn by an ilium on each side . The joint is a strong , weight transferral synovial plane joint with irregular elevations and depressions that produce interlocking of the two bones . The human body has two sacroiliac joints , one on the left and one on the right , that often match each other but are highly variable from person to person ."
