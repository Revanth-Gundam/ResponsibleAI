Icarus ' father warns him first of complacency and then of hubris , asking that he fly neither too low nor too high , so the sea 's dampness would not clog his wings or the sun 's heat melt them . Icarus ignored his father 's instructions not to fly too close to the sun ; when the wax in his wings melted he tumbled out of the sky and fell into the sea where he drowned ."

Her mother died when she was five years old . Her catchphrases during the early seasons of the series include `` how rude ! , '' `` well , pin a rose on your nose ! '' and `` hot dog '' . She eventually evolved into something of a tomboy in seasons four and five . Stephanie has a habit of spying on D.J. 's life by reading her diary and eavesdropping on her telephone calls ( having been caught in the act several times ) , and is generally the most athletic and nosiest of the Tanner girls . Her best friends in school are Gia Mahan and Mickey , whom she meets in season seven ( the former is the only one who appears through to season eight ) . Of the three sisters , Stephanie has dealt with the toughest issues , such as peer pressure into smoking ( in season seven 's `` Fast Friends '' ) , `` make - out '' parties ( in season eight 's `` Making Out is Hard to Do '' ) , joyriding ( in season eight 's `` Stephanie 's Wild Ride '' ) , and uncovering a classmate 's child abuse ( in season six 's `` Silence is Not Golden '' ) , as well as the death of her mother when she was only five . In her early years , she is very sentimental about Mr. Bear , a stuffed animal that her mother gave to her after Michelle was born ( this was the focal point of the season two episode `` Goodbye Mr. Bear '' ) . She and Jesse are the most abrasive when it comes to how they feel about Kimmy Gibbler ."

These new series C notes were slightly longer and narrower , and were the first ten - shilling notes to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II on the front . The reverse design incorporated the logo of the Bank of England . In the late 1960s it was decided that future banknotes should feature a British historical figure on the reverse . The first such note was the series D \u00a3 20 note , first issued in 1970 , featuring William Shakespeare . A design for a ten - shilling note featuring Walter Raleigh on the reverse was approved in 1964 but was never issued . Instead , in 1969 , as part of the process of decimalisation , a new fifty pence coin was introduced as a replacement for the ten - shilling note . The principal reason for the change was economy : the notes had an average lifetime of about five months whereas coins could last at least fifty years . The series C ten shilling notes ceased to be legal tender on 22 November 1970 ."

An example is if one says : `` I may agree that if two plus two equals five , then I am a monkey 's uncle '' . `` I 'll be a monkey 's uncle '' has been said to date from after 1925 , the date of the widely publicized Scopes Trial in the United States , where the term first appears .

        "Perry is a surname with several distinct origins . In England deriving from the Old English pyrige ( pear tree ) , referring to one who dwells by a pear tree , while in Wales Perry , along with Parry , arose as patronymics , via a shortening of `` ap Harry '' ( son of Harry ) . There are some variants in the Romance or Romantic languages ( derived from the Latin ) : Pereira , Pereyra , Pereyro , Pereiro , Pereiros Pereire , Perera , Perer , Perero , Pereros ; the Norman French perrieur ( quarry ) , possibly referring to a quarryman . Perry was recorded as a surname from the late 16th century in villages near Colchester , Essex , East England , such as Lexden and Copford . Perry has some resemblance with the Portuguese common surname Pereira , which means pear tree in Portuguese language . Because of that , many Portuguese immigrants to the USA ( especially Massachusetts ) chose to `` Americanize '' their Pereira surname to Perry . The Italian surname , Perri , related to `` Peter '' , is also often Americanized to Perry ."

The award announcement acknowledged the fact that `` the world 's nine nuclear - armed powers and their allies '' neither signed nor supported the treaty - based prohibition known as the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons or nuclear ban treaty , yet in an interview Committee Chair Berit Reiss - Andersen told reporters that the award was intended to give `` encouragement to all players in the field '' to disarm . The award was hailed by civil society as well as governmental and intergovernmental representatives who support the nuclear ban treaty , but drew criticism from those opposed . At the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony held in Oslo City Hall on December 10 , 2017 , Setsuko Thurlow , an 85 - year - old survivor of the 1945 atomic bombing of Hiroshima , and ICAN Executive Director Beatrice Fihn jointly received a medal and diploma of the award on behalf of ICAN and delivered the Nobel lecture ."

The team began play as the Indianapolis Colts for the 1984 National Football League ( NFL ) season . The Colts ' move was completely unannounced and occurred in the early hours of March 29 , 1984 , after years of lobbying for a new stadium to replace the inadequate Memorial Stadium . The franchise 's move continues to embitter many Baltimore natives decades afterward , and would have a lasting impact on the NFL , including another controversial relocation twelve years later that resulted in Baltimore receiving its current NFL team , the Ravens ."

Engelmann and Obst ( 1981 ) list the average venom yield at 420 mg ( dry weight ) . Accordingly , large quantities of antivenom may be needed to reverse the progression of symptoms developed if bitten by a king cobra . The toxins affect the victim 's central nervous system , resulting in severe pain , blurred vision , vertigo , drowsiness , and eventually paralysis . If the envenomation is serious , it progresses to cardiovascular collapse , and the victim falls into a coma . Death soon follows due to respiratory failure . Bites from a king cobra may result in a rapid fatality which can be as early as 30 minutes after the envenomation . The king cobra 's envenomation was even recorded to be capable of killing elephants within hours ."

        "Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume , so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals . The need to limit body weight in order , for example , to fly , has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species , such as bats . Most of the brain 's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge ( membrane potential ) of neurons . Most vertebrate species devote between 2 % and 8 % of basal metabolism to the brain . In primates , however , the percentage is much higher -- in humans it rises to 20 -- 25 % . The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time , but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions ; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET , fMRI , and NIRS . The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen - dependent metabolism of glucose ( i.e. , blood sugar ) , but ketones provide a major alternative source , together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids ( caprylic and heptanoic acids ) , lactate , acetate , and possibly amino acids ."
