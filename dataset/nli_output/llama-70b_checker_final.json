The term is derived from the name of a famous English ornithologist, Frank Parsons, who was known for his distinctive upturned nose.\n\nParsons was a well-known birdwatcher and naturalist who lived in the early 20th century. He was particularly interested in birds of prey, and his passion for these birds led him to become a prominent figure in the field of ornithology.\n\nOver time, Parsons' distinctive nose became a recognizable feature among birdwatchers and naturalists, and it became a sort of inside joke among them to refer to the upturned nose of a bird as a \"Parsons nose.\" The term has since become widely used in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and is often used in birdwatching circles to describe the distinctive nose of a bird of prey.\n\nIt's worth noting that the term \"Parsons nose\" is not a formal scientific term, but rather a colloquialism that has been adopted by birdwatchers and naturalists as a way of describing a distinctive feature of certain birds.",

The term must have been known as early as around 1400 AD , when a carpenter had been contracted to provide new choir stalls for St Mary 's Church , Nantwich . The vicar was either slow to pay the artisan , or did not pay at all . In retaliation , on the last misericord in the stalls , the carpenter carved a bird with an image of that Vicar 's face with protuberant nose as rump . The carving is still visible today ."

Christian was a member of the band and played a Gibson ES-150, which was one of the first commercially produced electric guitars.\n\nThe recording, which took place on August 1, 1939, was of a song called \"Flying Home,\" and it featured Christian's electric guitar playing a solo and providing rhythm accompaniment. The recording was released as a 78 rpm record and became a hit, helping to popularize the electric guitar as a jazz instrument.\n\nIt's worth noting that there were other musicians who experimented with electric guitars before Christian, but his recording with the Benny Goodman Sextet is generally considered to be the first commercial recording featuring an electric guitar.",

The exact location of the house is not specified, but it is implied to be a modest, middle-class home that is within walking distance of the Naval Academy.\n\nIt's worth noting that the movie was filmed on location in Annapolis and other parts of Maryland, so the scenes of Jack Ryan's home and the surrounding area are meant to represent the real-life location.",

However, some notable milestones and pioneers in the field include:\n\n1. CCTV (Closed-Circuit Television): CCTV was invented in the 1940s by a team of engineers at the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation). They developed a system that could transmit live images from a camera to a monitor, which was initially used for internal communication and monitoring purposes within the BBC. This technology laid the foundation for modern CCTV systems used in home security.\n2. Video Door Phones: The first video door phone was invented in the 1960s by a Japanese company, Panasonic (then known as Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.). This system allowed homeowners to see and communicate with visitors at their door via a camera and intercom.\n3. Home Security Systems: In the 1970s and 1980s, home security systems started to become more sophisticated, incorporating features like motion detectors, door and window sensors, and alarm systems. Companies like ADT (American District Telegraph) and Brinks Home Security were among the early providers of these systems.\n4. Digital Video",

Often depicted in art , Icarus and his father attempt to escape from Crete by means of wings that his father constructed from feathers and wax . Icarus ' father warns him first of complacency and then of hubris , asking that he fly neither too low nor too high , so the sea 's dampness would not clog his wings or the sun 's heat melt them . Icarus ignored his father 's instructions not to fly too close to the sun ; when the wax in his wings melted he tumbled out of the sky and fell into the sea where he drowned ."

She eventually evolved into something of a tomboy in seasons four and five . Stephanie has a habit of spying on D.J. 's life by reading her diary and eavesdropping on her telephone calls ( having been caught in the act several times ) , and is generally the most athletic and nosiest of the Tanner girls . Her best friends in school are Gia Mahan and Mickey , whom she meets in season seven ( the former is the only one who appears through to season eight ) . Of the three sisters , Stephanie has dealt with the toughest issues , such as peer pressure into smoking ( in season seven 's `` Fast Friends '' ) , `` make - out '' parties ( in season eight 's `` Making Out is Hard to Do '' ) , joyriding ( in season eight 's `` Stephanie 's Wild Ride '' ) , and uncovering a classmate 's child abuse ( in season six 's `` Silence is Not Golden '' ) , as well as the death of her mother when she was only five . In her early years , she is very sentimental about Mr. Bear , a stuffed animal that her mother gave to her after Michelle was born ( this was the focal point of the season two episode `` Goodbye Mr. Bear '' ) . She and Jesse are the most abrasive when it comes to how they feel about Kimmy Gibbler ."

The chords can be played on an acoustic or electric guitar, and you can add your own strumming patterns and rhythms to create a unique sound.\n\nHere are some tips for playing the song:\n\n* Use a steady, consistent strumming pattern throughout the verse and chorus. You can try a down-up strumming pattern, where you strum down on the strings on the first beat of each measure, and then strum up on the second beat.\n* In the bridge, you can play a simple arpeggio pattern, where you pluck the individual strings of the chord in a smooth, flowing motion.\n* Experiment with different rhythms and variations in the outro.

Van Leeuwenhoek was the first to observe microorganisms using a microscope and described the different types of microorganisms that he saw. Pasteur, on the other hand, demonstrated that microorganisms were responsible for the fermentation of sugars and the spoilage of food, and he proposed that microorganisms could also cause disease.\n\nThe germ theory of disease gained widespread acceptance in the 19th century, particularly after the work of Robert Koch, who developed a set of postulates that established the role of microorganisms in disease. Koch's postulates, which are still used today, include the following:\n\n1. The microorganism must be present in all cases of the disease.\n2. The microorgan",

They set up a camp at Daguragu, near the station, and remained there for nine years, despite facing harassment and intimidation from the station owners and the government.\n\nIn 1975, the Australian government, led by Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, negotiated a settlement with the Gurindji people, which included the granting of land rights to the Gurindji people over part of the Wave Hill station. The Gurindji people were also given control over the Daguragu camp, which became a Aboriginal-owned and run community.\n\nThe Wave Hill Walk-Off was a significant event in the history of Indigenous rights in Australia, and it helped to raise awareness of the struggles faced by Aboriginal people in the country.

However, the first combat-ready submarine was invented by a Confederate engineer named Horace Lawson Hunley, who designed and built the CSS Hunley.\n\nHunley was a native of New Orleans and a graduate of the United States Military Academy.

      "A new design for ten - shilling notes was introduced in 1961 , with the old notes ceasing to be legal tender in 1962 . These new series C notes were slightly longer and narrower , and were the first ten - shilling notes to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II on the front . The reverse design incorporated the logo of the Bank of England . In the late 1960s it was decided that future banknotes should feature a British historical figure on the reverse . The first such note was the series D \u00a3 20 note , first issued in 1970 , featuring William Shakespeare . A design for a ten - shilling note featuring Walter Raleigh on the reverse was approved in 1964 but was never issued . Instead , in 1969 , as part of the process of decimalisation , a new fifty pence coin was introduced as a replacement for the ten - shilling note . The principal reason for the change was economy : the notes had an average lifetime of about five months whereas coins could last at least fifty years . The series C ten shilling notes ceased to be legal tender on 22 November 1970 ."
