Her mother died when she was five years old . Her catchphrases during the early seasons of the series include `` how rude ! , '' `` well , pin a rose on your nose ! '' and `` hot dog '' . She eventually evolved into something of a tomboy in seasons four and five . Stephanie has a habit of spying on D.J. 's life by reading her diary and eavesdropping on her telephone calls ( having been caught in the act several times ) , and is generally the most athletic and nosiest of the Tanner girls . Her best friends in school are Gia Mahan and Mickey , whom she meets in season seven ( the former is the only one who appears through to season eight ) . Of the three sisters , Stephanie has dealt with the toughest issues , such as peer pressure into smoking ( in season seven 's `` Fast Friends '' ) , `` make - out '' parties ( in season eight 's `` Making Out is Hard to Do '' ) , joyriding ( in season eight 's `` Stephanie 's Wild Ride '' ) , and uncovering a classmate 's child abuse ( in season six 's `` Silence is Not Golden '' ) , as well as the death of her mother when she was only five . In her early years , she is very sentimental about Mr. Bear , a stuffed animal that her mother gave to her after Michelle was born ( this was the focal point of the season two episode `` Goodbye Mr. Bear '' ) . She and Jesse are the most abrasive when it comes to how they feel about Kimmy Gibbler ."

            "A new design for ten - shilling notes was introduced in 1961 , with the old notes ceasing to be legal tender in 1962 . These new series C notes were slightly longer and narrower , and were the first ten - shilling notes to feature a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II on the front . The reverse design incorporated the logo of the Bank of England . In the late 1960s it was decided that future banknotes should feature a British historical figure on the reverse . The first such note was the series D \u00a3 20 note , first issued in 1970 , featuring William Shakespeare . A design for a ten - shilling note featuring Walter Raleigh on the reverse was approved in 1964 but was never issued . Instead , in 1969 , as part of the process of decimalisation , a new fifty pence coin was introduced as a replacement for the ten - shilling note . The principal reason for the change was economy : the notes had an average lifetime of about five months whereas coins could last at least fifty years . The series C ten shilling notes ceased to be legal tender on 22 November 1970 ."

An example is if one says : `` I may agree that if two plus two equals five , then I am a monkey 's uncle '' . `` I 'll be a monkey 's uncle '' has been said to date from after 1925 , the date of the widely publicized Scopes Trial in the United States , where the term first appears . The Oxford English Dictionary 's earliest example is the phrase If that 's a joke I 'm a monkey 's uncle , from an Ohio newspaper on 8 February 1925 .

            "Perry is a surname with several distinct origins . In England deriving from the Old English pyrige ( pear tree ) , referring to one who dwells by a pear tree , while in Wales Perry , along with Parry , arose as patronymics , via a shortening of `` ap Harry '' ( son of Harry ) . There are some variants in the Romance or Romantic languages ( derived from the Latin ) : Pereira , Pereyra , Pereyro , Pereiro , Pereiros Pereire , Perera , Perer , Perero , Pereros ; the Norman French perrieur ( quarry ) , possibly referring to a quarryman . Perry was recorded as a surname from the late 16th century in villages near Colchester , Essex , East England , such as Lexden and Copford . Perry has some resemblance with the Portuguese common surname Pereira , which means pear tree in Portuguese language . Because of that , many Portuguese immigrants to the USA ( especially Massachusetts ) chose to `` Americanize '' their Pereira surname to Perry . The Italian surname , Perri , related to `` Peter '' , is also often Americanized to Perry ."

            "This species is capable of delivering a fatal bite and the victim may receive a large quantity of venom with a dose of 200 to 500 mg up to 7 ml . Engelmann and Obst ( 1981 ) list the average venom yield at 420 mg ( dry weight ) . Accordingly , large quantities of antivenom may be needed to reverse the progression of symptoms developed if bitten by a king cobra . The toxins affect the victim 's central nervous system , resulting in severe pain , blurred vision , vertigo , drowsiness , and eventually paralysis . If the envenomation is serious , it progresses to cardiovascular collapse , and the victim falls into a coma . Death soon follows due to respiratory failure . Bites from a king cobra may result in a rapid fatality which can be as early as 30 minutes after the envenomation . The king cobra 's envenomation was even recorded to be capable of killing elephants within hours ."

        "context": [
            "Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume , so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals . The need to limit body weight in order , for example , to fly , has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species , such as bats . Most of the brain 's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge ( membrane potential ) of neurons . Most vertebrate species devote between 2 % and 8 % of basal metabolism to the brain . In primates , however , the percentage is much higher -- in humans it rises to 20 -- 25 % . The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time , but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions ; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET , fMRI , and NIRS . The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen - dependent metabolism of glucose ( i.e. , blood sugar ) , but ketones provide a major alternative source , together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids ( caprylic and heptanoic acids ) , lactate , acetate , and possibly amino acids ."
